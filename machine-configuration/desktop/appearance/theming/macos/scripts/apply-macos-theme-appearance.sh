# Aligns macOS dark mode, desktop wallpaper, and accent color with the active
# theme. Driven by DESIRED_DARK_MODE, WALLPAPER_PATH, THEME_ACCENT_HEX, and
# ACCENT_FROM_HEX_SCRIPT env vars set by the home-manager activation wrapper.
# System Events can take >60s to respond during heavy nix-darwin activation,
# so each osascript is wrapped in `with timeout of 120 seconds` and stderr is
# silenced because failures are non-fatal (the script keeps moving).
# home-manager runs activation under `set -e`, where a failed command
# substitution in an assignment is fatal even with stderr silenced. A headless
# rebuild over SSH has no GUI session, so every System Events osascript exits
# non-zero; without `|| true` the GET assignments below abort the whole
# activation before later generations (home.file links, agent workspaces) run.
