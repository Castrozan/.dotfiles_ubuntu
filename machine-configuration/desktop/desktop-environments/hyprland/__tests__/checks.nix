Restarting mako, the hyprland portal and the focus daemon is a best-effort desktop nicety: nothing downstream in the activation consumes it and the machine keeps running without it, since a failed restart leaves the already-running instance in place. This check guards a DIFFERENT failure mode from the timeout check above and neither substitutes for the other: `timeout` bounds a hang, `|| true` absorbs a non-zero exit under set -e, and a wedged systemd manager hangs rather than exits";
