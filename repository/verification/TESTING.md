# Testing

## Taxonomy

Test category is the **directory** a test lives in, not its filename. Any module
anywhere in the repo may carry a `__tests__/` directory, split into `unit/`,
`integration/`, `e2e/`, and `evals/`; the runner tiers off those directory names.

- `unit/` — fast, mocked, no system state. The `--quick` (default) gate.
- `integration/` — needs docker, real services, or multi-step subprocess flows.
- `e2e/` — runs against a live system (runtime checks, live desktop and terminal
  behavior, perf thresholds).
- `evals/` — LLM eval yamls the `agent-eval` engine loads: the central corpus at
  `agent-harness/quality/evaluations/evals/` plus the per-skill suites it auto-discovers.

Agent LLM tests are a separate axis under `agent-harness/quality/evaluations/{evals,integration,e2e}/`
and keep their own flags (`--evals`, `--integration`, `--e2e`).

## Discovery

`repository/verification/run.sh` is the canonical entry point. Every script-test tier collects
through one shared helper, `_discover_test_files` in `repository/verification/runner/discovery.sh`,
which walks the **whole repo** for `*/__tests__/<tier>/` and prunes `.git`,
`node_modules`, `private-configuration`, `result*`, `.deep-work`, `.direnv`,
`.worktrees`, and `__pycache__`. A new module's tests are picked up with zero
runner edits — there are no hardcoded collection roots.

A tier collects at **any depth** below its tier directory: the path pattern stops
at `*/__tests__/<tier>/*` and the file name is matched separately, so grouping a
tier's files into subdirectories keeps them collected.
`repository/verification/__tests__/unit/test_every_test_file_is_reachable_by_a_tier.py`
fails whenever a test file in the repo sits where no collector reaches it.

Two discovery policies:

- **platform-scoped** (bats, pytest): excludes the capability roots belonging to
  the other platform, because script tests can be platform-specific. macOS reads
  `repository/verification/runner/linux-only-test-roots.txt` and Linux reads
  `darwin-only-test-roots.txt`; `foreign-platform-test-roots.sh` picks between
  them so the collectors and the coverage run agree.
- **cross-platform** (lua, qml): walks both platforms, because those pure-logic
  suites run identically everywhere.

Nix domain checks (`checks.nix`) are not shell-discovered; the flake aggregates
them via `repository/verification/nix-checks/default.nix` and they run under `--nix`. Agent
evals are driven by the `agent-eval` engine, not the shell collectors.

`repository/verification/run.sh --map` prints the whole suite as a tree (module × tier ×
counts: bats `@test` blocks, pytest functions, lua and qml suites, eval yamls, and a
`checks.nix: registered` marker per module) so the structure is self-describing.

The nix check inventory in that map is not counted out of the source.
`repository/verification/map-test-suite.py` evaluates the flake's `checks` attribute
set for the current system and counts the attribute names it gets back, so the total
is the set `--nix` would build rather than a guess at how many `checks.nix` files
declare. When that evaluation cannot run — nix absent, a non-zero exit, a timeout, or
output it cannot parse — the total prints as `unavailable` with the reason instead of a
number, because a wrong count reads exactly like a right one.

## Tiers

| Tier | Content | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| Map | prints the discovered suite tree, runs nothing | `--map` |
| Quick | line counts + `unit/` bats + `unit/` pytest + qml + qmllint + lua | `--quick` (default) |
| Nix | quick + every flake check attribute, built (`*/__tests__/checks.nix`) | `--nix` |
| Integration (scripts) | `integration/` bats + `integration/` pytest | `--integration-scripts` (alias `--docker`) |
| Runtime / e2e (scripts) | `e2e/` bats + `e2e/` pytest | `--runtime` |
| CI | line counts + `unit/` bats + `integration/` bats + flake checks + both baseline checks | `--ci` |
| Perf | desktop + shell benchmarks, both baseline checks with the age gate, `perf-runtime.bats` thresholds | `--perf` |
| Agent evals | `agent-harness/quality/evaluations/` single-turn / sessions / herdr | `--evals` / `--integration` / `--e2e` |

Additional modes: `--all` runs quick + nix + integration-scripts. `--coverage`
runs the `machine-configuration` `unit/` bats through kcov.

`--ci` is its own tier list, not the quick tier with skips. It drops pytest, qml,
qmllint and lua, and adds `integration/` bats, the flake checks, and the rebuild and
desktop baseline checks. Nothing it drops goes unrun: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
runs pytest, the qml suites, qmllint (with `QMLLINT_REQUIRED` set, so the lint is
mandatory there) and lua in a second job.

## Run

```bash
repository/verification/run.sh                       # quick tier (default)
repository/verification/run.sh --map                 # print the suite tree (module x tier x counts)
repository/verification/run.sh --nix                 # quick + nix eval tests
repository/verification/run.sh --integration-scripts # integration/ bats + pytest (alias: --docker)
repository/verification/run.sh --runtime             # e2e/ script tests (live system)
repository/verification/run.sh --all                 # quick + nix + integration-scripts
repository/verification/run.sh --coverage            # machine-configuration unit/ bats with kcov
repository/verification/run.sh --ci                  # the tier continuous integration runs
repository/verification/run.sh --perf                # benchmarks + fresh-baseline gate + thresholds
```

While editing, run the exact file instead of a tier — the loop is faster and the
failure stays local to what you changed:

```bash
bats machine-configuration/operating-system/power-management/__tests__/unit/setup-lid-switch-ignore.bats
pytest machine-configuration/development/testing/__tests__/unit/test_dotfiles_perf.py
```

Missing tools do not all fail the same way. Absent bats, nix, kcov or python3 make
their check print a warning and skip. Absent pytest is a failure whenever python test
files were collected: the runner refuses to skip silently and hand back a green run
that inspected nothing. Absent qmllint or quickshell skip too, unless
`QMLLINT_REQUIRED` is set. Docker is not detected by the runner at all — the
docker-backed tests skip themselves through
`repository/verification/helpers/docker-container-assertions.bash`.

### Performance testing

```bash
dotfiles-perf run               # benchmark all desktop components
dotfiles-perf run 10 tmux       # benchmark tmux only, 10 iterations
dotfiles-perf check             # compare the latest run against the baseline
dotfiles-perf validate          # validate the tracked desktop baseline
dotfiles-perf test              # pass/fail threshold tests (bats)
dotfiles-perf all               # full suite: benchmark + check + threshold tests
dotfiles-perf baseline          # measure and save new baseline
dotfiles-perf report            # show benchmark history
dotfiles-perf shell             # shell startup benchmark
dotfiles-perf rebuild           # nix rebuild benchmark
```

Validating a baseline and retaking one are different acts, and the runner separates
them. The baseline check validates the tracked file itself: that it parses as a JSON
object, that it records `git_commit`, `host` and `config`, that `threshold_percent` is
a number above zero, and that every measurement carries a value and a ceiling that are
numbers above zero. That runs everywhere, `--ci` included, because reading a committed
file needs no hardware and a malformed baseline should turn a push red wherever it is
noticed.

Baseline age is gated only by `--perf`. It is the one caller that adds
`--require-fresh`, which is what turns a stale or timestamp-less `generated_at` into a
failure, and it applies it to both `benchmark-desktop --check-baseline` and
`benchmark-rebuild --check-baseline`. The gate belongs there because nothing else can
clear it: clearing it means retaking the measurement, and the nix packaging injects
`DOTFILES_BENCHMARK_HOST` from the machine the flake builds the command for, so
`dotfiles-perf baseline` measures the owning host and no other. Continuous integration
therefore never benchmarks — a shared runner's numbers describe no machine this
repository configures.

`benchmark-desktop` is packaged on Linux only, so on darwin the `dotfiles-perf`
subcommands that delegate to it report the command as unavailable rather than
producing numbers; `benchmark-rebuild` and `benchmark-shell` are packaged on both.

## What Each Check Proves

These are not interchangeable, and no one of them stands in for another.

- `--ci` proves what a shared Linux runner can prove about a pushed commit: the
  line-count policy, `unit/` and `integration/` bats, every flake check, and that both
  tracked baselines are well formed.
- A named file run directly — `bats <file>`, `pytest <file>` — proves that one file
  with no tier around it. It is the editing loop, and the only form that keeps a
  failure local to the thing you touched.
- `rebuild` proves the Nix modules evaluate and the machine activates. It switches the
  host to the flake in `~/.dotfiles`, and on darwin aborts when `/run/current-system`
  did not move, so an activation that died mid-script cannot pass as success. It
  deploys the main checkout, not a worktree, so what it proves is what is already in
  `~/.dotfiles`.
- Live tests prove behavior on a running machine: a real window server, a real daemon,
  real windows. No automated tier replaces them.
  `machine-configuration/terminal/__tests__/e2e/README.md` says so directly about its
  own stress run, which cannot go in CI at any tier.
- `--perf` measures. A measurement is not a pass/fail claim about a commit; it is a
  number one machine produced under one load. That is why only the owning host
  produces it, and why continuous integration deliberately never runs it.

## Test Categories

| Category | Location | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Unit script tests | `*/__tests__/unit/*.bats`, `.../unit/test_*.py` | bats / pytest |
| Integration script tests | `*/__tests__/integration/*.bats`, `.../integration/test_*.py` | bats / pytest, docker or services |
| E2E script tests | `*/__tests__/e2e/*.bats`, `.../e2e/test_*.py` | bats / pytest, live system |
| Lua / QML suites | `*/__tests__/*_test.lua`, `*/__tests__/qml/run-qml-tests.sh` | lua / quickshell |
| Domain nix tests | `*/__tests__/checks.nix` | nix |
| Instruction surface lint | `agent-harness/quality/evaluations/__tests__/unit/test_instruction_surfaces_are_structurally_sound.py` | pytest |
| Agent evals | `agent-harness/quality/evaluations/{evals,integration,e2e}/`, `agent-harness/agent-instructions/skills/**/__tests__/evals/` | claude cli |

The A/B instruction-loading measurement is a recorded result, not a tier:
`agent-harness/quality/evaluations/instruction-loading-experiment.json` holds the paired comparison
(re-measure with `agent-eval --ab`), and
`agent-harness/quality/evaluations/__tests__/unit/test_instruction_loading_experiment_record.py` guards
that the record stays internally consistent and claims no significance its own
p-values do not support.

## Pytest Configuration

The root `pytest.ini` is authoritative for every pytest invocation in the repo,
including a bare `pytest` at the root:

- `filterwarnings = error`: a warning fails the run. This is not cosmetic; it is
  what catches leaked file descriptors and sockets, and it is what turns a test
  that reports its outcome by `return True`/`return False` (which pytest ignores)
  into a visible failure instead of a silent pass.
- `--strict-markers`: every `pytest.mark.<name>` must be registered under
  `markers` here. A module-local `pytest.ini` does not help: when the invocation
  spans several directories the rootdir resolves to the repo root and the local
  file is shadowed, so register markers in the root config only.
- `--strict-config`, `xfail_strict`: an unknown ini key or an unexpectedly
  passing xfail fails rather than warns.
- `norecursedirs` mirrors the prune list in `repository/verification/runner/discovery.sh`, so a bare root
  `pytest` never walks into `private-configuration`.
- `python_files = test_*.py` matches the collector's own pattern, so a live
  stress script named `*_test.py` is not collected as a test suite.

## Co-located Domain Tests

Tests live alongside their modules in `<module>/__tests__/`:
`agent-harness/<capability>` and `machine-configuration/<domain>/<capability>`,
both treated alike, split into `unit/`,
`integration/`, and `e2e/` subdirectories. The runner
discovers them by directory (`*/__tests__/<tier>/*.bats` and `*/__tests__/<tier>/test_*.py`)
— the subdirectory **is** the tier. There is no filename-suffix routing.

Bats tests load shared helpers from the root `repository/verification/helpers/` via relative path;
the number of `../` segments is the module's nesting depth (a test in
`machine-configuration/<domain>/<capability>/__tests__/unit/` is five levels deep, so it loads
`'../../../../../repository/verification/helpers/bash-script-assertions'`). Pytest tests resolve the
script under test through a `conftest.py` at the module's `__tests__/` level, which
applies to all three subdirectories.

## Writing Bin Script Tests

Test filename must match script name: a `scripts/foo` under a capability is covered by `<capability>/__tests__/unit/foo.bats` (or `integration/` / `e2e/` for the heavier tiers).

The shared helper at `repository/verification/helpers/bash-script-assertions.bash` auto-resolves the script path from the test filename, searching the `scripts/` directories under `machine-configuration/` and then under `agent-harness/agent-instructions/skills/`.

### Minimal template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

load '../../../../../repository/verification/helpers/bash-script-assertions'

@test "is executable" {
    assert_is_executable
}

@test "passes shellcheck" {
    assert_passes_shellcheck
}
```

### Available assertions

**Quality gates** — every script test should include these:

| Assertion | Checks |
|---|---|
| `assert_is_executable` | +x permission bit |
| `assert_passes_shellcheck` | shellcheck passes (skips if not installed) |
| `assert_uses_strict_error_handling` | `set -euo pipefail` in first 5 lines |

**Behavioral** — test script execution:

| Assertion | Usage |
|---|---|
| `run_script_under_test [args...]` | Run script under test, sets `$status` and `$output` |
| `assert_fails_with "pattern" [args...]` | Exits non-zero, output contains pattern |
| `assert_succeeds_with "pattern" [args...]` | Exits zero, output contains pattern |

**Static analysis** — test script content without executing:

| Assertion | Usage |
|---|---|
| `assert_script_source_matches "regex"` | Script source matches regex |
| `assert_script_source_does_not_match "regex"` | Script source does not match regex |
| `assert_script_source_matches_all "a" "b" "c"` | Script source matches all regexes |
| `assert_pattern_appears_before "first" "second"` | First pattern appears before second |
| `assert_installs_apt_packages pkg1 pkg2` | `apt-get install` lines for each package |
| `assert_writes_config_to_path "/path" "val1" "val2"` | Config path and values in source |
| `assert_activates_systemd_service name` | `activate_service` or `systemctl enable` for service |

### Example: behavioral test

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

load '../../../../../repository/verification/helpers/bash-script-assertions'

@test "is executable"     { assert_is_executable; }
@test "passes shellcheck" { assert_passes_shellcheck; }

@test "shows usage with no args" {
    assert_fails_with "Usage:"
}

@test "processes valid input" {
    assert_succeeds_with "Done" --flag value
}
```

### Example: setup script (static analysis)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

load '../../../../../repository/verification/helpers/bash-script-assertions'

@test "is executable"              { assert_is_executable; }
@test "passes shellcheck"          { assert_passes_shellcheck; }
@test "uses strict error handling"  { assert_uses_strict_error_handling; }

@test "installs required packages" {
    assert_installs_apt_packages foo bar
}

@test "configures service" {
    assert_writes_config_to_path "/etc/foo.conf" "KEY=value"
    assert_activates_systemd_service foo
}
```

### When setup/teardown is needed

Override `setup()` and `teardown()` for tests that need temp files or state. The helper assertions still work because they resolve the script path from the test filename, not from a variable.

```bash
setup() {
    TEST_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
    cd "$TEST_DIR" || return 1
}

teardown() {
    rm -rf "$TEST_DIR"
}
```

## Policies

1. **Every capability script gets a test file.** At minimum: `assert_is_executable` + `assert_passes_shellcheck`.
2. **Test filename = script name, category = directory.** `<capability>/scripts/foo` → `<capability>/__tests__/unit/foo.bats`. The helper auto-resolves the script path from the filename regardless of which tier directory the test lives in.
3. **Static over execution for setup scripts.** Scripts requiring sudo/root are tested via content analysis, not execution. Verify configs, packages, and service activation are declared correctly.
4. **Behavioral tests for CLI scripts.** Scripts that take user input should test error paths (missing args, bad input) and success paths.
5. **Containerized integration tests go in `integration/`.** Place docker-backed tests under `<domain>/__tests__/integration/`; they run via `--integration-scripts` (alias `--docker`) and stay out of the quick gate by directory, not by filename. Build and drive the container through `repository/verification/helpers/docker-container-assertions.bash`, which builds `repository/verification/Dockerfile` (Ubuntu with nix) and skips the test when no docker daemon is reachable, rather than shelling out to `docker` by hand.
6. **No external test libraries.** `repository/verification/helpers/bash-script-assertions.bash` covers common assertions. Avoid adding bats-assert/bats-file/bats-mock unless a concrete need arises.
7. **Shellcheck is mandatory.** All bash scripts must pass shellcheck. The `assert_passes_shellcheck` assertion handles environments where shellcheck isn't installed by skipping.
8. **Names mean things.** Test directories mirror source directories. File and function names describe what they test, not how. Follow `agent-harness/agent-instructions/core-rules/core.md` naming and script conventions.
9. **Canonical script pattern.** All shell scripts under `__tests__/` follow the repository's script conventions: `set -Eeuo pipefail`, `readonly` constants, `main()` at bottom, `_` prefixed private functions, no comments. `machine-configuration/development/system-rebuild/scripts/rebuild/rebuild` and `repository/verification/run.sh` are the worked examples.
