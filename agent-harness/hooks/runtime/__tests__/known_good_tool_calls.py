"""Tool calls an agent makes all day, which no guard may ever deny.

Every guard here is written as a pattern over raw command text, and a pattern
widened to catch one more evasion catches ordinary work with it. The failure
is invisible from inside the rule that caused it: the guard looks correct, the
new case is denied, and the agent that hit it has no way to tell a rule from a
bug.

So the corpus lives outside any one guard and every deny-emitting hook is run
against all of it. A rule that costs a known-good call fails here, in the name
of the call it broke, rather than in a session weeks later.

Entries are whole tool calls rather than command strings because context
decides: a rebuild in the foreground is correct and the same rebuild
backgrounded is denied, and a guard can only be judged against the call the
agent actually makes.
