"""What must never appear on a hot hook path, whatever the count says.

A budget catches drift in aggregate. These catch the specific mistakes that
made the budget necessary: a pathlib bootstrap dragging three modules behind
it, a handler imported before its matcher could select it, and a third-party
import that ties the hooks to an environment rather than the bare interpreter
run-hook.sh pins.

Read, Bash and Edit are all checked because they cost differently. A Read
selects only the two matcher-less guards; a Bash selects four more; an Edit is
the one tool call that also spawns the PostToolUse dispatcher behind it.
