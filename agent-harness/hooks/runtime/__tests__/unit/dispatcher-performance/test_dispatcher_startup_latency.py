"""Wall-clock backstop for the hook that runs on every single tool call.

PreToolUse is registered with a `.*` matcher, so a fresh interpreter starts
for every Read, Bash, Grep and Edit an agent issues, and whatever that
interpreter does before dispatching is charged to the agent's turn.

The bound is deliberately coarse, because the ratio of dispatch cost to
interpreter cost does not survive a change of machine. Both terms are timed
here, but they are not made of the same work: the floor is mostly an already
resident interpreter binary, while dispatch is module reads, so slower
storage inflates the ratio rather than cancelling out. A first attempt at
0.65 measured 0.45 to 0.51 locally and 0.72 on CI and went red. Warming both
sides removes the bytecode-compile and cold-cache asymmetry, which is also
the honest thing to measure, since a session pays the warm cost hundreds of
times and the cold one once.

What survives is one memorable invariant: dispatching a Read must cost less
than starting the interpreter it runs in. The shape this replaced, a pathlib
bootstrap with twelve eagerly imported handlers, measured 1.11 floors. The
precise regression detector is test_dispatcher_import_budget.py, which counts
modules and is exact on any hardware; this file only catches a regression
gross enough to show up through timing noise.
