"""A denial says what is blocked and where to read the rest.

A reason is pasted into the agent's context every time the guard fires, so a
recipe inlined there is paid for on every repeat offence and competes with the
work in view. The detail belongs where it is already maintained: a reference
file beside the hook, or the skill that owns the tool.
