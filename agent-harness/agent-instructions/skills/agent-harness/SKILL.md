name: agent-harness
description: Debug and configure the Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode harness instead of the project it edits. Use for settings, skills, hooks, model routing, transcripts, MCPs, session state, or tool-targeting failures.
---

### Scope

Treat the harness as runtime infrastructure, not application code. Use this when a setting, skill, hook, connector,
subagent, model, transcript, session, or tool target behaves differently from the configured source.

### Live state over files

Apply core [evidence](../../core-rules/core.md#evidence) and [completion](../../core-rules/core.md#completion) while
reading the declared source, running harness, process, and session. A deployed file does not prove a harness loaded it,
and a resumed session can retain state from before a rebuild. Compare versions and live state before calling a
documented behavior a defect.

### Configuration ownership

Keep durable settings and instruction surfaces declarative. Preserve harness-owned mutable state where the deployment
model requires it, and restart a session only after its replacement is available. Use `agent-session` for a generic
restart or exit instead of assuming a harness-specific command.

### Place instructions by scope and authority

Place a rule by who needs it and how long it must remain available. Core, including
[coding](../../core-rules/core.md#coding), owns universal session-long defaults even when they activate only for one
kind of work; repository context owns local facts and policy; path-scoped rules own matching-file constraints; harness
surfaces own harness mechanics; skills own bounded procedures. Make every complementary source point to the canonical
authority instead of restating it. Never leave behavior expected across turns or compaction solely inside an on-demand
skill, because it disappears outside that skill's loading window.

### Separate adherence evidence and enforcement

Treat instruction salience, behavioral evidence, and enforcement as separate controls. Put persistent behavioral
authority at its proper scope. Enforce it mechanically only when the forbidden state and material exceptions are precise
enough to avoid unacceptable false results; otherwise an edit-parsing hook becomes a conflicting policy engine. Use
evaluations to expose adherence regressions, not as proof that prose forces behavior.

### Instruction authority diagnosis

Before diagnosing or migrating duplicated, missing, stale, or wrong-horizon behavior, read [instruction
authority](references/instruction-authority.md) and trace the rule through live delivery before selecting its owner.

### Workflow authoring

Before authoring or reviewing a workflow that calls agents or models, read [workflows](references/workflows.md) and
budget its control flow.

### Knowledge

Read [knowledge](references/knowledge.md) for harness-specific traps, including transcript locations, configuration
roots, model routing, hook protocols, skill discovery, connector gates, and command anchoring.
