### Builtin worktree

Claude Code has a built-in `--worktree` flag and EnterWorktree/ExitWorktree tools for simple isolation. Use built-in
worktree for quick subagent isolation where you need a throwaway branch. Use this skill's manual workflow when you need
persistent worktrees, multiple simultaneous branches, or PR workflows from worktrees.

### Worktree creation

Fetch latest main before branching, then create the worktree at the destination `location_is_enforced` fixes. Avoid
branch names containing `/` as they create nested directories that break the convention. Use the Git worktree command's
help for exact syntax.

### Location is enforced

A worktree never lives outside its repository, because a sibling checkout is a stray copy of the repo that outlives the
branch, nothing gitignores it, and a temp directory hands it to the OS purge and to whatever scans unexcluded paths. The
accepted destinations are `.worktrees/<branch>` and the built-in `.claude/worktrees/<name>` that `--worktree` and
EnterWorktree create; a bare name, `../<name>`, an absolute path, and anything under `/tmp` are all refused. The rule
binds you, not the tooling: the `worktree_location_guard` PreToolUse hook refuses a stray `git worktree add` only where
the harness runs hooks, so never read the absence of a refusal as permission. For a genuinely sanctioned exception
prefix the command with `WORKTREE_OUTSIDE_REPOSITORY_SANCTIONED=1`. Relocate a stray worktree with `git worktree move`,
which preserves its branch and uncommitted state, except where the repo carries submodules: git refuses to move or
remove that worktree at all, so delete the directory and `git worktree prune`, first confirming its commits are
ancestors of the upstream branch and its submodules clean.

### Traps

PR commands must run from the main repo directory, not the worktree: `gh` and `glab` misdetect the repo context inside
worktrees. Use `--head <branch>` to target the worktree branch. Never run `git checkout` or `git switch` in the main
repo: the main repo stays on its current branch at all times. All branch work happens exclusively inside the worktree
directory. Each worktree is bound to one branch; if you need a different branch, create a new worktree. If the worktree
CWD gets deleted mid-session, recreate the worktree rather than silently falling back to main. Never commit to main when
worktree isolation was requested; this is the most common failure mode. After PR is merged or pending review, return to
main workspace and rebuild so the system returns to stable state. Keep the worktree locally for follow-up work during
review.
