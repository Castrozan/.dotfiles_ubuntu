### Silent failure traps

Multiple shape files trace the same geometry for different purposes (fill vs stroke). They share the same property
interface but are not programmatically linked. Changing one without the other compiles fine, renders with mismatched
fill and border. Multiple color systems coexist across different UI layers. Mixing them compiles fine, produces wrong
colors at runtime with no error. Read imports at the top of the file you're editing to know which system that layer
uses. Region masking controls click-through. Adding a new visual element without adding it to the mask list makes it
visible but unclickable. Read the mask region list when adding new interactive areas. PathArc direction (Clockwise vs
Counterclockwise) compiles and renders either way: wrong direction takes the long way around, producing visual
artifacts. Read existing arcs in the same file to match the convention before adding new ones. qmldir files register
types for cross-directory imports. Missing entries produce "module not installed" errors that look like missing packages
but are just registration. Check existing qmldir files in the directory when adding new types.

### Service lifecycle

Config directories are nix-managed symlinks. After changes: use the nix skill's rebuild capability to regenerate
symlinks, then restart the service via systemctl. Never use pkill on quickshell processes. Discover IPC targets
dynamically with `qs ipc --any-display -c bar show`. Call with `qs ipc --any-display -c bar call TARGET FUNCTION
[ARGS]`. Use IPC to trigger UI states for testing: more reliable than mouse simulation. Always pass `ipc --any-display`:
the systemd service registers its display as `wayland,wayland-1` while callers see only `wayland-1`, so the default
display filter rejects the match and the call fails with "No running instances". Three quickshell services run
independently:

`quickshell-bar.service`: vertical bar (dashboard, launcher, sidebar via IPC: `qs -p
~/.dotfiles/machine-configuration/desktop/quickshell/bar/program-configuration ipc --any-display call dashboard toggle`)

`quickshell-switcher.service`: window switcher (`qs -c switcher ipc --any-display call switcher
open/next/prev/confirm/cancel`)

`quickshell-overview.service`: workspace overview (`qs -c overview ipc --any-display call overview toggle/open/close`)
The overview reads colors from `~/.config/hypr-theme/current/theme/quickshell-bar-colors.json` via FileView with live
file watching. Colors auto-update on theme change. Grid config (rows, columns, scale, effects) lives in
`machine-configuration/desktop/quickshell/overview/program-configuration/config.json`. Theme-to-M3 mapping is in
`Appearance.qml:applyHyprTheme()`.

### Visual verification

After visual changes: restart, wait 2 seconds, trigger UI state via IPC if needed, screenshot with grim, read the file
to inspect. Prefer IPC show commands over hover simulation for popouts.

### Debugging

Journal logs first: a QML syntax error in any imported file prevents the entire shell from loading. Invisible
components: check z-order, dimensions, and the Region mask list. Stale code after restart: verify nix symlinks still
point to current dotfiles, not a cached store path.

### Development workflow

Read existing code. Make changes. Commit. Rebuild (use the nix skill). Restart service. Trigger UI via IPC. Screenshot
and verify. Check logs. If broken: logs, fix, commit, rebuild, restart, repeat.
