### Core authority

Core [evidence](../../../core-rules/core.md#evidence), [completion](../../../core-rules/core.md#completion), and
[coding](../../../core-rules/core.md#coding) own persistent judgment, verification, and code-quality defaults;
`SKILL.md` owns the review method, finding contract, severity, and verdict. This file owns only the bounded dotfiles
pre-push review procedure.

### Mandate

A substantive dotfiles review runs inside the current harness after the change is committed and before it is pushed. It
launches no workflow and no reviewer subagent, and stays read-only until its verdict is delivered. Repository context
decides when a change is substantive.

### Procedure

Review exactly the commits the task added: 1) recover the intended outcome, the constraints, and the behavior that must
not change before reading any diff; 2) identify the exact task commit range and the absolute repository root, anchoring
every later command at that root against sibling checkouts; 3) read one whole-range diff plus its stat, excluding shared
working-tree state and unrelated commits;

4\) inspect changed lines, callers, tests, and deployment edges through all six lenses (logic, Nix, style, instructions,
coverage, exposure); 5) trace each changed path through realistic inputs, failure states, ordering, resource use,
security boundaries, and downstream consumers; 6) prove or discard every candidate with file-and-line evidence before
reporting it;

7\) compare delivery to every user requirement and to the behavior that must stay unchanged; 8) report findings under
the parent skill contract or `No findings.`, naming the range, files, and lenses reviewed and closing with a verdict on
whether the goal is achieved.

### Follow up

Fix confirmed findings in cohesive follow-up commits and repeat the procedure; never amend the reviewed commit, because
peers may already have built on it.
