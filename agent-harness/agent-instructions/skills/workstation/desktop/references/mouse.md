### Usage

Run `scripts/mouse.sh` with subcommands: click X Y, move X Y, scroll DIRECTION [AMOUNT], drag X1 Y1 X2 Y2. Click accepts
--button left|right|middle and --double.

### Pitfalls

Requires ydotool and its daemon ydotoold: script auto-starts the daemon if not running but ydotoold needs uinput access
(the user must be in the input group or ydotoold must run as root). Coordinates are absolute pixels from top-left of the
virtual display (spans all monitors). Always take a screenshot first to identify target coordinates; never click
blindly. Unlike keyboard/clipboard, ydotool works on both Wayland and X11 (it uses kernel uinput, not Wayland
protocols). For browser clicks, use the browser skill instead (element-based, not coordinate-based).
