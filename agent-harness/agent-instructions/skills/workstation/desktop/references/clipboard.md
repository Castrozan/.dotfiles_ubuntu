### Execution

Run `scripts/clipboard.sh` with subcommand: `read`, `write`, or `watch`. Pass `--type MIME` for typed content. Write
accepts text as argument or via stdin.

### Pitfalls

Wayland-only: requires socket access. Image reads save to /tmp and print the path (not raw binary). Empty clipboard
returns empty string, not an error. The `watch` subcommand runs until interrupted; don't use in unattended one-shot
automation.
