### Put the seam where the reason to change is

Name the thing that changes for its own reason and cut there. Dependencies point inward toward the rules that outlive
them: domain logic knows nothing about the database, the framework, the transport or the UI, and every replaceable thing
sits behind an interface the domain owns rather than one the vendor shipped. A module that imports its caller is a
defect, not a style choice.

### Size the design to the evidence

Build what the current requirement needs plus the seam where the next one is already known to land. An abstraction with
one caller is a guess; a duplicated decision with three callers is debt. Moving a boundary later costs less than
defending one chosen early, so prefer the structure that is cheap to cut again. Treat familiar patterns and existing
architecture as candidates constrained by evidence, not as reasons to stop evaluating the boundary.

### Decide state and failure before the happy path

Say where state lives, who is allowed to write it, and what the system does on partial failure before designing the
success case. Idempotency, retry semantics and ordering guarantees are design decisions; deciding them after the callers
exist means rewriting the callers.

### Diagram only to settle something

Reach for UML when it decides an argument: a sequence diagram for ordering and failure across components, a component or
class diagram for dependency direction, a state diagram for a lifecycle with illegal transitions. Draw it in the message
or the plan. A committed diagram goes stale and then lies.

### Deployment is part of the design

Decide what runs where, what it needs at boot, what happens on restart, how it is observed and how it rolls back. A
design that cannot be deployed or reverted is unfinished, and infrastructure discovered after the code is written
reshapes the code.

### Core coding authority

Core [coding](../../core-rules/core.md#coding) owns persistent naming, comment, cohesion, dependency, precedent, and
abstraction defaults. Use this skill to settle structural ownership, state, failure, deployment, and boundary decisions;
let repository instructions own module layout, scripting language, and local conventions.
