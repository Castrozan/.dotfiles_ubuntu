description: Build a web page section by section through the compose-page workflow with a per-section meaning gate. Use for building, creating, or composing web and landing pages.

### Workflow boundary

Build the page the user describes by invoking the `compose-page` workflow (Workflow tool, name `compose-page`). Never
hand-scaffold the markup yourself, which reproduces the random-skeleton-of-placeholders failure this skill exists to
prevent.

### Invocation

Pass the workflow an args object. `brief` is the subject, the audience, and the single action the page drives, drawn
from the user's request. `output` is the target format, defaulting to a self-contained semantic HTML5 file with one
inline style block when the brief is silent. `constraints` carry design tokens, voice, length, and anything the content
must not invent. The workflow throws without a `brief`, so resolve one from the request or ask for it before invoking
rather than passing an empty brief.

### After it returns

The workflow returns the thesis, the section spine, the per-section gate outcomes, and the assembled `page`. Write
`page` to the file the brief names, or a sensible path in the target project, and report the thesis plus which sections
the final gate accepted or revised so the meaning trail stays visible. Do not edit the returned markup to satisfy a
requirement the gate ignores: the gate judges content meaning, not visual-spec compliance, so a missed theme or token
belongs back in `constraints` on a re-invocation, not in a hand-patch that detaches the page from its proof.

### Workflow authority

The phases, schemas, and gate criteria live in the deployed `compose-page` workflow, the single source of truth; this
skill only drives it.
