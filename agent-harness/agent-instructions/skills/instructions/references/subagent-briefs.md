### Purpose

A brief is the prompt passed to the Agent or Team tool when spawning a one-off subagent. Unlike a skill or agent
definition, it lives only for the lifetime of that single tool call. It must be self-contained because the spawned agent
inherits no memory of the parent conversation.

### Core delegation authority

Core [delegation](../../../core-rules/core.md#delegation) owns what the parent must understand, judge, verify, and
synthesize. This chapter only shapes the self-contained brief used for one bounded delegation call.

### Colleague who walked in

Write briefs for a smart colleague who just walked into the room. They have no context for what you tried, what you
ruled out, or why this matters. Include: what you are trying to accomplish, what you already learned, the constraints,
the form the answer should take, and the response length. Trust the agent to make judgment calls inside a well-described
problem; do not micromanage with a step list when the steps depend on what the agent finds.

### Lookup vs investigation

Lookups hand over the exact command or query because the answer is known and the agent just needs to execute it.
Investigations hand over the question and let the agent decide steps, because prescribed steps become dead weight when
the premise turns out wrong. Pick the right mode before writing the brief, and do not mix them.

### Never delegate understanding

Apply core [delegation](../../../core-rules/core.md#delegation) before writing the handoff. Phrases like "based on your
findings, fix the bug" push synthesis onto the delegate. Include the relevant paths, settled mechanism, concrete change,
and evidence the result must produce. If you cannot state them, finish the analysis before delegating implementation.

### Scope the deliverable

Subagent results return as a single message that the orchestrator must summarize for the user. Cap response length
explicitly ("under 200 words", "punch list, done vs missing", "filenames only"). Open-ended briefs produce token-heavy
responses that the orchestrator then has to compress anyway, doubling the cost. Scope the deliverable in the brief
itself.

### Terse prompts produce shallow work

Command-style prompts ("review this file", "find the bug", "check the migration") produce generic shallow work because
the agent has no judgment context. Add the surrounding problem so the agent can weigh tradeoffs instead of mechanically
following a narrow instruction. A brief that is too short is the most common cause of subagent output that misses the
point.

### Name applicable skills

Name the skills the task depends on and tell the agent to invoke each via the Skill tool before starting.
