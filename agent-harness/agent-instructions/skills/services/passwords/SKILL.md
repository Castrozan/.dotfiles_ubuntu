description: "Bitwarden vault access: retrieve and store personal passwords via the `bw` CLI and `bw-session` helper. Use when retrieving, storing or confirming a password or credential."

### Vault

Lucas's passwords live in a hosted Bitwarden free account (bitwarden.com, castro.lucas290@gmail.com); the `bw` CLI is
installed on every host and agents read and write it non-interactively. It holds his Brave browser logins plus arr-stack
and service credentials, and is the sole password store now that the old `pass`/GPG store is retired.

### Session

Mint an unlocked session before any `bw` read or write, exporting the account's data directory in the same shell:
`export BITWARDENCLI_APPDATA_DIR="$(jq -r '.personal.applicationDataDirectory' ~/.config/bitwarden-cli/accounts.json)";
export BW_SESSION="$(bw-session)"`. The `bw-session` helper logs in with the API key and unlocks with the master
password from agenix secrets, with no prompt, desktop app, or biometrics. It exports that directory only inside its own
process, so a caller that skips the export mints a real token against the account vault and then reads the untouched
default vault, where every command answers `locked` and a working unlock reads as a failed one.

Each account registered in that same registry file has its own directory and is selected by passing its name to
`bw-session`; `personal` is the default. Re-run whenever `bw` reports `Vault is locked` or `not logged in`; sessions
expire.

### Reading

Fetch by site name or URL: `bw get password <query>`, `bw get username <query>`, `bw get item <query>` for full JSON
(`.login.username`, `.login.password`, `.login.uris`), and `bw get totp <query>` when an item carries a seed. `bw get
password` fails with `More than one result found` when several items share a domain: list with `bw list items --search
<term>` and pass the chosen `.id`. Run `bw sync` first if a freshly added item is missing.

### Writing

Store a credential ad hoc by piping a filled template: `bw get template item | jq '.name="X" | .login.username="u" |
.login.password="p"' | bw encode | bw create item`. Edit with `bw edit item <id>` (base64 JSON on stdin). Creates and
edits sync automatically.

### Handling

Retrieved passwords are secrets: use them inline, never echo full values into chat, logs, or committed files, and mask
(first char plus length) when confirming a lookup. The master password and API key are root credentials that live only
in agenix; never reproduce them elsewhere.
