### Stance

Enforce patterns, not just suggest. When user proposes violation: 1) Explain WHY pattern exists. 2) Show CORRECT way. 3)
Only deviate if user explicitly accepts trade-off AND no alternative exists.

### Architecture

The dependencies sub-flake owns every input and the root `flake.nix` takes it as its single input, because Nix refuses
to force a thunk for `inputs` and a sub-flake is the only indirection it accepts. Bump one input with `nix flake update
dependencies/<name>`; the bare name matches nothing and only warns.

`repository/flake-assembly/outputs.nix` owns outputs: it names every host explicitly and calls
`nixos-machine-factory.nix` or `darwin-machine-factory.nix` once per host to build `nixosConfigurations.<alias>` (full
NixOS system, e.g. chise) and `darwinConfigurations.<alias>` (nix-darwin macOS, e.g. rin, kira). Adding a host is one
more explicit call; never reintroduce a host list, an attrset iteration or a `pathExists` directory scan, all of which
hide which hosts exist.

A factory file is curried, taking the platform arguments at import and the per-host ones at each call; `channels.nix`,
`home-manager.nix` and `checks.nix` are single application and keep noun names. Each machine factory builds its channels
from its own system and threads `hostname` (the alias), `username`, `isNixOS` and `isDarwin` through `specialArgs` /
`extraSpecialArgs`.

### Platform detection

`isNixOS`, `isDarwin`, and `hostname` (the alias) are injected via specialArgs / extraSpecialArgs. Consume as function
args: `{ isNixOS, isDarwin, hostname, ... }:`. Use `lib.mkIf` to guard. NEVER use `builtins.pathExists /etc/NIXOS` -
broken in pure flake evaluation.

### Directory organization

New reusable modules belong under the `machine-configuration/<domain>/<capability>/` owner, with the deployment
mechanism expressed by the file-name suffix. Do not grow a machine entry point or shared core merely because several
machines import the capability.

machine-configuration/machines/shared-home-manager-core.nix - shared home-manager core every machine imports
machine-configuration/machines/shared-darwin-{home-manager,system-nix-darwin}.nix - the layer both macOS hosts share

machine-configuration/machines/`<alias>`/home.nix - per-machine home-manager entry point (IMPORTS ONLY)
machine-configuration/machines/`<alias>`/home/ - optional per-machine home-manager submodules

machine-configuration/machines/user-packages-`<user>`-home-manager.nix - per-user shared package set (used by multiple
machines)

machine-configuration/development/version-control/git-private-home-manager.nix - per-user git router (sources
private-configuration/machines/`<hostname>`/git-user.nix)

machine-configuration/network/ssh/ssh-private-home-manager.nix \- per-user ssh router (sources
private-configuration/machines/`<hostname>`/ssh.nix) machine-configuration/network/ssh/scripts/ - shared per-user ssh
activation scripts

machine-configuration/`<domain>`/`<capability>`/ - a capability owning its nix modules, raw config, scripts and tests;
deployment mechanism is the file-name suffix (-nixos, -nix-darwin, -home-manager)

machine-configuration/machines/`<alias>`/system/ - machine-specific system config; NixOS retains nixos-system.nix for
per-user-on-the-host bits

### Repository special directories

secrets/\*.age - agenix encrypted secrets secrets/secrets.nix - public key mappings private-configuration/ - private git
submodule holding the private half of these same domains under the same capability rule; machines/`<alias>`/ mirrors the
per-machine split above agent-harness/agent-instructions/ - instruction surfaces and shared skills deployed to every AI
tool

### Rebuild execution

Use the rebuild capability (references/rebuild.md) - it has platform detection, commands, and troubleshooting.

### Git workflow

Commit files first before rebuilds, nix reads from git index. NEVER git add -A or git add . Parallel work is going on
the repo. Always add each file you changed with git add FILE.

### Package channels

pkgs: stable (check flake.nix for version) unstable: nixos-unstable latest: same as unstable, updated with nix flake
update dependencies/nixpkgs-latest but done daily. DO NOT UPDATE THE FLAKES MANUALLY unless user specifically requests
it.

### Anti patterns

Reject: config in home.nix (goes in module), packages via specialArgsBase (use inputs), secrets without pathExists
guard, scripts in random locations, hardcoded usernames, new file without import, rebuild without staging, git add -A,
committing directly, builtins.pathExists /etc/NIXOS for NixOS detection (use isNixOS specialArg).

### Delegation to expert

Delegate to references/expert.md: Nix syntax/evaluation/lazy evaluation, derivations/overlays/complex expressions,
module system internals, debugging evaluation errors, Nix ecosystem tooling questions. Handle directly: file locations
in this repo, repository patterns/anti-patterns, module structure/import organization, secrets workflow, rebuild
failures and enforcing conventions.

### Script packaging

Python scripts are packaged via a module-level helper in scripts.nix (e.g. `mkSystemPythonScript`,
`mkMediaPythonScript`) that wraps `pkgs.writeText` + `pkgs.writeShellScriptBin` with `exec python3`. For scripts needing
shared libraries, the shell wrapper sets PYTHONPATH to the lib directory. For external deps, use
`pkgs.python3.withPackages`. Each module with scripts has a `__tests__/` directory with conftest.py for sys.path setup.
Mock subprocess calls in tests, never call real system tools.
