### Invocation

The docker-manager script lives at `agent-harness/agent-instructions/skills/services/nix/scripts/docker-manager`. Run it
with `--help` for the authoritative command reference. It is the curated interface; do not shell out to raw `docker` or
`podman` commands even if they seem faster. The script enforces ordering (stop before remove), prevents data loss
(volume backup before delete), and surfaces errors the daemon hides.

### Safety boundaries

Common cascade trap: `docker rm` succeeds on stopped containers; `docker rmi` fails if a container still references the
image. The script handles this cascade. A running or stopped container holds a reference to its image: removing the
image fails until the container is removed. Image removal is idempotent only if the tag is unused; rebuilding with the
same tag orphans the old image. Dangling images accumulate: the script's image-cleanup handles this, verify current
prune policy before using it.

### Container state

Containers have multiple states (created, running, paused, stopped, exiting, dead). Status checks are point-in-time
snapshots: a container running at inspection time may crash milliseconds later. When scripting multi-step workflows
(start, wait for healthcheck, then exec), insert actual waits, not just state queries. "Container is running" does not
mean "ready to accept traffic."

### Execution in containers

`docker exec` works only on running containers. If exec must happen regardless of state, use the script's
container-ensure-running helper or wrap the exec with explicit start logic. Exit codes from exec are reliable; container
logs are not (buffering, log driver limits). When debugging failed execs, check container logs AND service logs
separately.

### Volume and data

Volumes survive container removal. Removing a container does NOT delete data. Named volumes and bind mounts persist
independently. Trap: deleting a container leaves orphaned volumes consuming storage. If data loss is possible, the
script requires explicit `--force-delete-volumes` or will refuse the operation.

### Network isolation

Containers joined to custom networks cannot reach containers on the default bridge directly. Host mode bypasses
isolation entirely. Overlay networks require swarm mode. Script abstracts network selection.

### Logging and events

Container logs are served by the log driver (json-file default). Large logs consume disk or are dropped depending on
driver. `docker logs` follows running output; logs from exited containers may be truncated. Use `docker logs --tail=N
--since=` for bounded queries.

### Registry and pulls

`docker pull` fetches from registry (Docker Hub default, can be overridden). Pulling fails cleanly if the image does not
exist; building fails if dependencies are missing. Pushing requires authentication.
