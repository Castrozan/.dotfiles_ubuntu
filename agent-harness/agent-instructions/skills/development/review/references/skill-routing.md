### Skill routing diagnosis

When a skill exists but the model bypasses it (uses raw tools instead), diagnose the routing chain before fixing
anything. Three failure classifications: 1) unreachable, the skill exists but its description doesn't match the user's
input pattern (fix the description); 2) outcompeted, the model sees a direct tool (WebFetch, browser MCP) and tries it
before considering skills (fix with a PreToolUse hook); 3) misrouted, the model routes to the wrong skill (fix with eval
tests and description disambiguation).

### Diagnosis workflow

1\) Reproduce by getting the exact user input that failed routing; 2) check routing evals for existing coverage of that
input pattern; 3) read the target skill's description and ask whether it semantically matches the input; 4) check if
direct tools (WebFetch, browser MCPs) would intercept before skill routing fires; 5) classify the failure, then fix.

### Fix skill description

Update the skill's SKILL.md description AND the matching entry in the routing eval's shared system prompt. These must
stay in sync. Descriptions drive all routing - embed the patterns users actually type (URLs, domain names, action
verbs). Run the routing eval to verify.

### Fix with pretooluse hook

When direct tools outcompete skills (model tries WebFetch on a URL that needs a skill), create a PreToolUse hook that
blocks the tool and redirects. Look in the hooks directory for existing URL-routing hooks as a pattern. The hook
receives tool input on stdin as JSON, inspects the URL, and exits 2 with a stderr redirect message. The redirect message
must be actionable: give the model the exact command or API call, not just the skill name (Skill(name) may fail in fresh
sessions), inline the minimal working command so the model can act immediately, and use wildcard matchers for MCP
servers with multiple tools to avoid gaps.

### Fix with eval tests

Add routing eval tests. Each test gives the shared router prompt a user input and asserts the correct skill name. Use
output_not_contains to verify competing skills are NOT selected. Test bare inputs (just a URL), inputs with context
("what does this say?"), and ambiguous multi-domain inputs.

### Live testing

After eval tests pass, verify in a real Claude Code session. Evals test an isolated router; real sessions have competing
tools, MCPs, and hooks. Use the `herdr` skill to spawn a herdr agent with the failing input as the prompt. Capture pane
output to verify the model used the correct skill/tool chain. Iterate on hook messages until the model follows the
redirect on first attempt.
