### Extension decision

Use a skill when the AI should auto-detect relevance, when workflow guidance and progressive disclosure help, and when
behavior depends on what the agent finds at runtime; use a script when the user wants explicit control over a simple
repeatable, template-based action with fixed inputs and outputs.

### Skill format

Skills live under `skills/<group>/<name>/SKILL.md` in the instruction source and deploy to AI agents through
home-manager. Name each skill in lowercase kebab-case after its directory and provide a routing description. Keep
optional instruction chapters under `references/` and executable logic under `scripts/`; keep SKILL.md as the minimal
entry point. Use the Markdown grammar and prose limits from the instructions SKILL.md for every instruction chapter.

### Skill discovery

Description drives discovery. Models match semantically, so embed synonyms in prose. Every skill description is injected
into every agent session; each word is a shared token tax across all interactions. Cap at 2 sentences, ~30 words (the
repo validator rejects above 35). Add "Do NOT use for..." only where a sibling skill creates real confusion. All trigger
information goes in the description, not the body.

### Router pattern

When a skill grows past one screen, move optional chapters into `references/<chapter-name>.md` and keep SKILL.md as a
router with one-line loading hooks. The router loads on every invocation; references load on demand. Keep triggers and
orientation in SKILL.md. Link each chapter with a relative Markdown destination resolved from the containing file; never
use a repository-root or absolute path for a skill reference.

### Hardskill belongs in scripts

Scripts and their '--help' output are the authoritative source for exact commands, flags, and syntax. Skills document
what scripts cannot express: silent failure modes, non-obvious ordering constraints, domain boundaries, and which things
must stay in sync.

If a script's name and '--help' already tell the agent how to use it, the skill must not repeat that information; when a
skill wraps scripts, the body is traps and boundaries, not a reference card for the CLI surface. The exception is
genuinely non-obvious hard constraints where wrong syntax silently succeeds (branch naming formats, socket paths that
fail silently, staging rules that cause data loss), which earn their token cost because the agent cannot discover them
by running '--help' or reading source; the test is "would the agent silently produce wrong results without this line?",
and if no, cut it.

### Skill authoring preflight

Before committing any SKILL.md, answer these; if any answer is "yes", revise first: 1) is the description over 2
sentences or ~30 words? cut it (loads in every agent session); 2) does the body repeat what the frontmatter description
already says? remove it; 3) does any section belong to a different skill's responsibility? move it;

4\) are there hardcoded paths, tokens, or environment-specific values that will go stale? generalize to patterns; 5)
would dense two-line prose replace a verbose example block without losing clarity? prefer density; 6) does any content
exist only because raw research data was fresh in context? strip the research artifacts; 7) does any section explain
what code does? remove it and keep only what the model cannot infer.
