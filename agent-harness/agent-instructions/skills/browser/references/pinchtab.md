### Last resort boundary

Read and use this workflow only after the last-resort eligibility gate in `SKILL.md` passes. This file never authorizes
switching away from Chrome DevTools.

### Workflow

PinchTab is a CLI, not an MCP, and drives a separate persistent-profile Chrome. `pinchtab nav` auto-starts its local
server. The declarative config enables its browser capabilities on every host and defaults the shared server to headed.

Work in this order: 1) `pinchtab nav <url>` navigates, with `--new-tab` or `--snap` when needed; 2) `pinchtab snap`
returns refs, which change after navigation or interaction; 3) `pinchtab click <ref>` and `pinchtab type <ref> <text>`
interact; 4) `pinchtab screenshot --output <file>` saves visual evidence while `pinchtab capture` pairs it with a
snapshot; inspect the saved file with the harness's image-reading tool before using it as evidence; 5) `pinchtab text`
extracts text while `pinchtab health` and `pinchtab tabs` inspect server state.

Use `pinchtab help` or a command's `--help` for the changing CLI surface. Switch the one shared server with
`pinchtab-mode headless` or `pinchtab-mode headed`; a mode switch restarts it for every client, and the next rebuild
restores headed mode. Never attempt a second server for another mode because both instances race the same pidfile.
