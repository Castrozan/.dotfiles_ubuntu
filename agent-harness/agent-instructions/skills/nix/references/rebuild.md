### Announcement

"I'm using the nix skill's rebuild capability to apply configuration changes."

### Prerequisite

Nix reads from git index, not working tree. Stage all modified .nix files before rebuilding. Never use `git add -A` or
`git add .` (may stage unrelated parallel work).

### Execution

Run `rebuild`; it auto-detects platform (NixOS vs standalone home-manager) and user. Sources nix-daemon.sh if needed. If
`nix: command not found`, source `. /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh` first.

### Timeout trap

Rebuilds from source (forks, custom packages) can take 10+ minutes. Follow the active-waiting pattern: redirect output
to a file (`rebuild > /tmp/rebuild.log 2>&1 &`), then set up a `/loop` monitor that tails the log file to check concrete
progress and defines the process state or log evidence that means success and failure. Never pipe through `tail` in the
background; it buffers everything and produces empty output. Never poll with timeout `>` 60000ms: a single long poll
eats the entire agent timeout budget and bricks the session.

### Dry run

Validate configuration before applying by running `rebuild` with `--dry-run`. Catches syntax errors, missing imports,
and evaluation failures without modifying the system.

### Platform difference

NixOS: Full system rebuild affecting services, kernel, boot. Home-manager is integrated as a module. Home-manager
standalone: User-level only: packages, dotfiles, user services. The rebuild script handles detection automatically.

### Stale fetcher cache

`rebuild` resolves the flake via the git fetcher (`?submodules=1`), which caches the repo revision in
`~/.cache/nix/fetcher-cache-v*.sqlite` and can pin an old commit so the build keeps using stale source after you commit;
`--refresh`, `--option eval-cache false`, and `--option tarball-ttl 0` do not clear it. Symptom: `rebuild` exits 0 but
the change is not live and the built store path never changes; confirm by comparing `builtins.getFlake`'s `.rev` against
`git rev-parse HEAD`, a mismatch means the cache is stale. Fix: `rm -f ~/.cache/nix/fetcher-cache-v*.sqlite*` then
rebuild, deleting only this file and not all of `~/.cache/nix` which forces needless input re-downloads. Verify a deploy
from the installed artifact, not the exit code: the hyprland python scripts are `writeShellScriptBin` wrappers that
`exec` a separate `<hash>-source.py`, so grep the `-source.py` the wrapper execs (the wrapper itself silently lacks your
change).

### Troubleshooting

Build fails with import error: file not staged (check git status). Attribute not found: module not imported in home.nix
or configuration.nix. Unfree package: rebuild sets NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1. Rate limit: install home-manager locally.
Wrong config: session-context User field must match flake configuration name.
