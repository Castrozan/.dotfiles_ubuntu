description: Agent behavior instructions specific to the .dotfiles repository
alwaysApply: true

### Orientation

If you are reading this you are inside the dotfiles repo, the single declarative source of truth for every machine it
configures. The live machine is a projection of this repo, so its whole configuration - packages, services, host and
user settings, dotfiles, secrets, packaged scripts, even this instruction file - is produced by a nix module here and
materialized by a rebuild.

A change made by hand on the running machine is drift the next rebuild erases; a change made here is the real thing,
which is why most tasks reduce to finding the module that already owns what you are changing and editing that.

Before guessing where something lives, load the `nix` skill: it carries this repo's map - module layout, host split,
secrets, script packaging, the "where does this belong" call.

### Repo local skills

`nix` and `agent-harness` describe this repo and deploy only into its ignored project skill directories. Claude and
OpenCode discover them here. Codex discovers only home skills, so read
`agent-harness/agent-instructions/skills/services/nix/SKILL.md` and
`agent-harness/agent-instructions/skills/agent-workflows/agent-harness/SKILL.md` directly. Optional knowledge chapters
live at `references/knowledge.md` beneath each skill.

### Stewardship

This repo is continuously kept synced, green, and pushed by an autonomous per-machine steward agent, declared in the
clawde-agents module and built from the clawde flake input where its behavior lives. You still push your own commits,
because CI is the test gate and a commit that never reaches origin is never verified, but push only what fast-forwards:
leave a diverged history, a rebase, or a submodule gitlink conflict to the steward rather than reconciling it by hand,
which races its live loop, unless explicitly told to act in the steward's place.

A checkout that is ahead of, behind, or diverged from origin/main is normal in-flight state the steward will reconcile;
never surface it as a task pending on the human.

### Configuration

Every configuration change lives in this repo and applies declaratively through its capabilities - nix modules,
home-manager, agenix, overlays, packaged scripts - never by mutating a machine by hand outside the repo. Fold new config
into the existing module structure rather than adding one-off files. Make it work on every system type this repo targets
(NixOS and darwin) when the feature allows, guarding platform-specific pieces behind `isNixOS`/`isDarwin`. The same
holds across the harnesses this repo drives: reach Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode together, then Pi and Hermes where
each one supports the capability.

### Nvim keymaps

Before suggesting, adding, or restoring any Neovim keybind, read and follow
`machine-configuration/editors/neovim/KEYMAPS_POLICY.md`: native Vim built-ins first, LazyVim conventions second, custom
maps only as a documented last resort, never shadowing a native key. Keep that file current whenever a binding is added
or removed on purpose; bindings it lists as removed stay removed unless the owner names one explicitly.

### Codex managed settings ownership

MCP servers are declared in nix at `agent-harness/harnesses/claude-code/mcps/default.nix` for Claude and
`agent-harness/harnesses/codex/config.nix` for Codex. Codex deploys an authoritative nix-source for managed settings,
including `mcp_servers`, then seeds a mutable live config. The live model and entries in projects, marketplaces, and
plugins survive rebuilds. The declarative source wins every other key collision, so an MCP dropped from its nix source
disappears from the live config on the next rebuild.

### Machine local wrapper

On chise only, the live system is not built straight from this repo: a machine-local entrypoint flake at
`~/zanoni-system` (outside this tree) imports the public chise config from here and layers a private overlay on top, and
`rebuild` builds that entrypoint, not this repo directly. So a service, unit, secret, or option that is live on chise
but absent from this repo is most likely owned by that overlay, not missing: check `~/zanoni-system` before declaring it
undeclared or re-adding it here.

That entrypoint is its own standalone private git repo, with its own origin, not this repo and not a submodule of it, no
CI and no peer stewards; the chise steward keeps it reconciled with its origin fast-forward-only, so commit a wrapper
change into that repo rather than assuming a rebuild alone captures it.

Keep `~/zanoni-system` limited to private OpenClaw integration and secrets. Generic host, provider, and harness
configuration belongs in this repo; do not make public configuration depend on the private wrapper. Chise-specific;
other hosts build directly from this repo.

### Scripts

Python 3.12 is the default language for scripts. Use bash only when the script is a thin wrapper gluing shell-native
tools (tmux send-keys, fzf, sysctl pipelines) where Python would just be subprocess.run calls. Python scripts run via
Nix - no uv, no venv, no pip. Only scripts under 10 lines of actual logic may live inline in `.nix` files via
`pkgs.writeShellScript`, `pkgs.writeText`, or similar builders. Anything longer goes to a dedicated file under the
module's `scripts/` directory and is referenced by path. Long inline scripts are unreadable, unformattable, untestable,
and escape from nix string interpolation rules destroys quoting. When in doubt, extract.

### Performance

Treat responsiveness, memory, CPU, process count, and network activity as behavior in this repository's clients,
daemons, and terminal interfaces: measure the changed path, set a bound, avoid unbounded render or polling work, and
prefer incremental updates over whole-state recomputation.

### Testing

Never present code that has not been rebuilt and tested. For .nix files, a successful rebuild IS the primary
verification. Do the local work first, through the rebuild and the manual tests the change calls for, and only then push
(see [workflow](#workflow)). Pushing is what starts CI: it runs the script tiers and `nix flake check` on every push,
and CI is the test gate, so a local full-suite pass is not what proves a change.

Reach for `repository/verification/run.sh` only to reproduce a job CI turned red, or to iterate on a test you are
writing. The same goes for a whole pytest tier directory (`*/__tests__/unit`, `*/__tests__/integration`), bare `pytest`,
`pytest agents`, `pytest .`, and `nix flake check`: run a specific test file, or use `rebuild` as the local nix
verification.

Test every Neovim change live in a newly created Herdr pane; automated and headless checks do not replace this manual
test.

### Change review scope

Before pushing a substantive change, load the `review` skill and follow its dotfiles-change procedure over the exact
commits you added; when the harness cannot load skills, read
`agent-harness/agent-instructions/skills/development/review/SKILL.md` and its `references/dotfiles-change.md` chapter
instead.

Commit first: this checkout is shared, so a review of the working tree reads whatever peers left uncommitted, and a
confirmed finding belongs in a follow-up commit rather than an amend a peer may already have built on.

A change is substantive when a wrong edit would survive formatting and still change machine or agent behavior, a build,
a deployment, a dependency, an interface, a test, security, a secret, what this public repository exposes, or an
operational instruction, or when correctness depends on several files changing together.

Skip the review only when every hunk is demonstrably non-semantic, meaning a formatting or prose correction that alters
no command, path, identifier, factual claim, policy or behavior; review the whole change when substantive and
non-substantive hunks are mixed or the classification stays uncertain. Changed line and file counts never decide this,
and skipping the review never excuses the rebuild or the tests.

### Workflows

Treat a workflow's model calls as delegation that consumes the task's agent budget, and keep every dotfiles workflow at
a fixed call ceiling with no per-item model calls. Author further dotfiles workflows as `dotfiles-*` under
`agent-harness/harnesses/claude-code/workflows/`, deployed to `~/.claude/workflows/`, rather than ad-hoc subagent
fan-out. Give each one a matching `dotfiles-*` command in `agent-harness/workflow-commands/`, because that command is
how every harness other than Claude Code reaches the workflow at all.

### Workflow

After editing any file in the dotfiles repo, execute this sequence before responding, no exceptions: 1) format edited
files; 2) stage each file with git add specific-file, never -A; 3) commit; 4) review the commits you just added when
they are substantive (see [change review scope](#change-review-scope)); 5) rebuild for any file change in this repo (see
[rebuild](../rebuild-guidance/rebuild-agent-instructions.md#rebuild));

6\) push, which starts the run in the background; 7) do not block on the run: continue with the next independent piece
of the task while CI works, and check the verdict only when other work is exhausted and a response to the user is due -
`gh run list --commit $(git rev-parse HEAD) --json databaseId,name,conclusion` gives the run ids, then `gh run watch
<id> --exit-status` blocks on each until it finishes and exits non-zero when it ends red; a short sha matches no run and
a just-pushed commit has none for a few seconds, so pass the full sha and retry an empty list rather than reading it as
a verdict;

8\) if the rebuild or CI fails: fix and repeat from 1; 9) only after a green rebuild and green CI: respond to user.
Every CI job reports all of its failures rather than dying on the first, so read the whole run and fix the batch in one
pass instead of pushing once per error.

### Worktrees

This checkout keeps many sibling worktrees live at once. Search them before declaring an expected edit missing, because
an edit you cannot find here is usually sitting in another checkout rather than lost.

### Applying clawde agent changes

A clawde agent's runtime config - heartbeat gate, interval, prompt, launch command, active hours, rotation - lives in a
per-agent file the wrapper re-reads on every restart, so a rebuild's warm redeploy applies config changes in place, no
respawn needed.

The exception is a change to the agent-wrapper code itself: the running wrapper keeps executing the code it launched
with, so wrapper-code changes stay dormant until the window is fully respawned (reboot, or kill the window so the
supervisor recreates it from the new spec). Never assume rebuilt wrapper code is live on the running agents - check the
live process and respawn if it still runs the old code.

Every other fleet trap that leaves no trace in the source - resume identity, supervisor reconciliation, channel gating,
the steward loop, the shared server cgroup - is in `agent-harness/harnesses/clawde/knowledge.md`; read it before
touching any agent, supervisor or heartbeat behavior.

### Agent instructions

The eval baseline (`agent-harness/quality/evaluations/baseline.json`) is a committed snapshot that CI guards via
`agent-eval --check-baseline` against absolute pass-rate floors and a relative regression gate that fails when the
overall pass rate drops more than a fixed margin below the previous committed baseline, and a freshness gate that fails
once the recorded `generated_at` is older than the window in `run_evals_baseline.py`.

Do not re-run `agent-eval --save-baseline` after editing agent instructions; the full suite is a slow LLM run whose
routing evals flake, so a proactive re-save bakes transient failures into the committed baseline. Re-save only when
`--check-baseline` fails CI, whether on a genuine pass-rate regression or on staleness, or to deliberately record a
meaningfully improved instruction surface.

### Herdr server restart

herdr runs as one shared server, the `default` session, hosting the whole clawde fleet, the steward, and the interactive
session at once. Rebuild must preserve attached clients and running pane processes; installing a new package does not
mean the running server has changed. Activating a server update requires the user's explicit approval, current or prior:
live handoff preserves pane processes but disconnects clients, while a full `herdr server stop` and relaunch restarts
every session and drops the whole fleet. Keep server activation separate from ordinary rebuilds. When a full restart is
approved, stop the server detached after a short delay so the final report flushes before this session drops.
