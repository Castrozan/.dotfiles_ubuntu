        Named subsets of the dotfiles skills, each materialized at
        .local/share/claude-skill-sets/<set>/.claude/skills for a clawde agent to
        load through skillDirectories, whichever harness it runs. The clawde flake
        hardcodes that path for the steward set, so it is an interface rather than
        an internal detail. Declare a set from the module that owns the agent
        consuming it, not here, so the skill list stays next to the agent whose job
        defines it. A name matching no skill on disk is dropped rather than failing
        the build, so a set survives a skill rename until someone notices the agent
          lost it.

        Directory carrying the same skills an interactive session gets, for an
        agent whose job is whatever a keyboard session would do. An agent that
        already runs the claude harness inherits these from the machine tier and
        loses nothing by naming this too, since a set overlapping the machine tier
        collapses to one entry; naming it is what keeps the skills when the agent
        is switched onto a harness that reads no machine tier.
