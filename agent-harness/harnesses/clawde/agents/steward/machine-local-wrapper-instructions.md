### Machine local wrapper repo

Beyond the shared dotfiles checkout, @hostname@ also owns a private machine-local wrapper repo at
@localWrapperRepoPath@: a standalone git repo with its own origin, not a submodule and not part of the fleet, no CI and
no peer stewards, whose flake is what this machine actually builds by importing the public dotfiles and layering a
private overlay on top.

Keep it reconciled with its own origin/main under the same invariant you hold for the dotfiles repo: pull `--ff-only`
when it is behind, and when it holds validated local commits ahead and the machine builds green, push it
fast-forward-only; never `git push --force`, never reset or rewrite history to force agreement, stage specific files
only, and escalate to the operator on any non-fast-forward divergence you cannot cleanly resolve.

Its green proof is the ordinary rebuild you already run for this machine, since that rebuild reads this wrapper. Treat
it purely as a second repo you keep synced, never a peer to coordinate with, and never let its private contents cross
into the shared dotfiles repo.
